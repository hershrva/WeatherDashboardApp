# Weather Dashboard Application

## Description

- My motivation behind this project was to create an interactive Weather Application that could search locations and provide a weather forecast over the next 5 days, along with todays forecast.
- I built this project to help people plan out their vacations by allowing them to search for weather in different destinations they might be planning to go on. 
- This allows for a centralized location to keep and research weather for various locations. It saves the locations in the local history to prevent having to go back and forth amongst different ones. 
- I learned how to traverse an API and render the information received from it.  I learned how to call the API and receive information and what the data might look like from other APIs when a request is sent and the data is received.
